## A Functionally Pure, Declaritively Constructed, Deterministic, State Machine with its Hydra API (where if you have a Terminating State, it returns it to its Initial State)

### Start with your initial state


### Describe your transitions

### Moira uses Hydra to build your API

### Moira uses Clothos to handle uncaught Exceptions and give a deterministic state
